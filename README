Google Analytics extension for MediaWiki
========================================

This extension adds the Google Analytics tracking snippet to every page.

**Please note**: this is a fork of [Extension:GoogleAnalytics](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Google_Analytics_Integration).
The following differences exist:
- Somewhat different code structure
- We have a few more options (see [#Configuration]):
  - Options for setting cookie path / domain
  - Enhanced Link Attribution
  - Remarketing plugin
  - Tracking user groups using a custom dimension
  - Additional plugins: [riveted] and [scrolldepth] by [Rob Flaherty].

## Configuration ##

### Configuration options
  
| Variable                                           | Value | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                    
|----------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsAccount                 | null  | Your analytics account number (e.g. "UA-12345678-1")
| $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsAnonymizeIP             | true  | Instruct Google anonymize the user's IP (by removing the last octet, or last 80 bits of IPv6 address) before any additional processing on Google's servers; see [anonymizeIp].
| $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsCookiePath              | null  | Useful if you need to [restrict tracking to a single sub-directory]; set to something like '/tracked-dir'.
| $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsEnahncedLinkAttribution | false | Enables [Enhanced Link Attribution]. You also need to [enable Enhanced Link Attribution in the reports interface].
| $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsSegmentByGroup          | false | Push the user's groups into a custom var, allowing later segmentation in the GA dashboard. See ```$wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsSegmentByGroupDimension``` as well.
| $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsSegmentByGroupDimension | 1     | If $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsSegmentByGroup is enabled, this is used to determine the custom dimension number to be used.
| $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsTrackExtLinks           | true  | Track clicks on external links (including interwiki and interlanguage) using non-interaction events.
| $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsRemarketing             | false | Enables remarketing and advertising reporting. You also need to [enable remarketing in property settings]. You can read more about [remarketing in Google Analytics].
| $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsRiveted                 | false | Enables the [riveted] plugin., which in turn is configured by `$wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsRivetedConfig`.
| $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsRivetedConfig           | false | An array with the following options: reportInterval (30), idleTimeout (30), nonInteraction (true), reportOnce (false), userTiming (false). All of these except the last two are described on the plugin's homepage; reportOnce makes the plugin shut off after sending a single first even, while userTiming turns off sending a User Timing event.
| $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsScrollDepth             | false | Enables the [scrolldepth] plugin., which in turn is configured by `$wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsScrollDepthConfig`.
| $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsRivetedConfig           | false | An array with the following options: minHeight (0), elements ([]), percentage (true), userTiming (false), pixelDepth (false), nonInteraction (true), reportOnce (false). All of these except the last one are described on the plugin's homepage; reportOnce makes the plugin shut off after sending a single first event.
| $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsPageGrouping            | false | Kol-Zchut specific! Classify pages into Content Groups, based on the first 2 visible categories. You must set up content groups in advance.

### Exemption from tracking
Users with the "noanalytics" right are exempt from tracking; by default this is applied only to bots.

### Integration with other extensions
From version 3.5 and forward there is an hook to allow other extensions
to inject code before sending the page view: `GoogleAnalytics::SendPageView`.
Extensions may also return `false` through this hook to prevent the page view from being sent.

This extension also includes a ResourceLoader module for sending events,
named `ext.googleUniversalAnalytics.utils`.


## Roadmap
- Split out Kol-Zchut-specific parts by using the new sendPageView hook.

## Changelog ##

### v3.6.1
- Other extensions can return false from "GoogleAnalytics::beforeSendPageView" to stop the page
  view from being sent automatically.

### v3.6.0
- Update the extension to MediaWiki 1.25 Extension Registration (extension.json)

### v3.5
- New MediaWiki hook "GoogleAnalytics::beforeSendPageView" to allow other
  extensions to add data before the hit (i.e., custom dimensions)

### v3.4.0
- Two additional plugins: [riveted] (for active time tracking) and [scrolldepth] (scroll tracking).


### v3.3.0
- Finally switch to Universal Analytics (which upstream did long ago)
- Move external link tracking to a ResourceLoader module


### v3.2.6
Bugfix: $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsOtherCode was added even if user/page were excluded.

### v3.2.5
- Improved documentation
- Partial rebase (we still much diverge) against upstream (v3.0.1):
    * Allow to ignore namespaces and specific pages/special pages
      ($wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsIgnoreNsIDs, $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsIgnorePages, $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsIgnoreSpecials)
    * add $wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsOtherCode to add any other analytics code desired.
	* we still use the older ga.js

### v3.2.4
Track interwiki & interlanguage links

### v3.2.3
use the "noanalytics" group permission to exempt users from tracking, instead of the
previous ```$wgGoogleUniversalAnalyticsIgnoreGroups```.

### v3.2.2
Make sure ```_setAccount``` is always first, in case another extension pushes something before this loads

### v3.2.1
Bug fixes for Page Grouping

### v3.2.0
Optional external links tracking (on by default), Page Grouping by categories

### v3.1.0
Optional ["Enhanced Link Attribution"](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2558867)
